# Unity and libpd tutorial

This is the code repo for our [tutorial](http://melodrive.com/blog/how-to-use-pure-data-in-unity/) on using libpd as a native Unity plugin. It's based on the excellent [libpd4unity-starter](https://github.com/cmuartfab/libpd4unity-starter) project, and of course relies on the wonderful [libpd](https://github.com/libpd) itself.  All dependencies are included in the project for ease of use.
